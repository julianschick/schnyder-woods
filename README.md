# The Flip Graph of Split and Merge on Schnyder Woods

A 'Schnyder Wood' is a special orientation and colouring of the edges of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph that is embedded into the plane. The figure shows a Schnyder wood on 13 vertices.

The operations 'split' and 'merge' locally alters a Schnyder wood as depicted in the image below.

Split and merge are mutually inverse and can, thus, be interpreted as 'flip' and 'flop' giving rise to a classical flip graph. Below the flip graph of split and merge for n equals five (every Schnyder wood in this flip graph has five vertices) is shown.
